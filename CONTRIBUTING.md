# How to contribute

Maltrieve is a community-driven project and we happily accept contributions from anyone interested in helping with malware research. To keep things well-organized and flowing smoothly, here are a few guidelines.

Please note that this project is released with a Contributor Code of Conduct. By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting the project owner Kyle Maxwell at krmaxwell@gmail.com.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http:contributor-covenant.org), version 1.0.0, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/)


## GitHub

You need a [GitHub](https://github.com) account for most everything like opening or commenting on issue and submitting code to the project via pull requests. Feel free to use a pseudonym - we care about the code & the data and will respect your privacy.

## Documentation

We need more documentation: use cases, better installation instructions, common problems, etc. Even if you don't write code, writing up your experiences with Maltrieve can help others!

## Bug reporting

Yes, Maltrieve has bugs. Some of them we know about (and are working on), others we need somebody to tell us about. If you submit a bug report (issue), please be sure to include the actual program output and let us know anything relevant about the environment (OS and Python version, for example, or if you have made any changes to the code). In particular, we need to know which version you're running (listed in `setup.py`) and the results of `pip freeze`.

## Pull requests

The easiest and best way to do this is to [fork our repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and then [send a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) **against the `dev` branch.** In your description, please be sure to note any related issues (for example, if your PR fixes a previously-reported bug or implements an existing enhancement request). We will review and possibly request additional changes before merging. The best patches will be those that conform to [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) and refrain from introducing new dependencies as much as possible. Sometimes that will be okay, of course, if it does something new and awesome! Also please keep in mind that Maltrieve is released under the GPL v3 and this will include all code sent back to us.
